            <p class="mb-4">
              Double glazing is a popular window technology used in homes to improve energy
             efficiency, reduce noise, and enhance overall comfort. In this article, we will explore
             how double glazing works, its benefits, and why it's a wise investment for your home.
            </p>
  
           <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">How Double Glazing Works</h3>
              <p class="mb-4">Double glazing consists of two panes of glass separated by an air or
             gas-filled space. This space creates an insulating barrier that minimizes heat transfer
            between the inside and outside of your home. </p>
  
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Key Benefits of Double Glazing</h3>
             <p class="mb-4">Double glazing provides a wide range of benefits:</p>
           <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
              <li>
                <strong>Improved Energy Efficiency:</strong> Double glazing reduces heat loss, lowering
                  your energy bills and making your home more environmentally friendly.

              <li>
                <strong>Increased Security:</strong> Double glazing can enhance the security of your home.
