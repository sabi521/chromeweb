        </h2>
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <p>
            At Chrome Double Glazing, we specialize in the installation of
            high-quality UPVC windows, perfect for both residential and
            commercial properties. UPVC (Unplasticized Polyvinyl Chloride) is a
            durable, energy-efficient, and low-maintenance material that has
            become the preferred choice for modern window solutions.

            Benefits of UPVC Windows:
          </h2>

          <ul className="space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> UPVC windows offer excellent
              insulation, helping you reduce energy bills by keeping your home
              warmer in winter and cooler in summer.
            </li>{" "}
            <li>
              <strong>Durability:</strong> Resistant to rot, rust, and
              corrosion, UPVC windows can withstand harsh weather conditions,
              making them perfect for the UK climate.
            </li>{" "}
            <li>
              <strong>Low Maintenance:</strong> Unlike wood, UPVC does not
              require frequent painting or varnishing. A simple wipe-down is all
              it takes to keep your windows looking new.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sound Insulation:</strong> UPVC windows can reduce outside
              noise, offering a quieter, more peaceful indoor environment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Security:</strong> Our UPVC windows are fitted with
              multi-point locking systems, providing enhanced security for your
              home.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Aesthetic Appeal:</strong> Available in a range of styles,
              colors, and finishes, UPVC windows can complement any property
              design.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Our team of expert installers ensures that each window is fitted to
            the highest standards, ensuring energy efficiency and long-term
            performance. Whether youâ€™re looking to replace old windows or
            upgrade to modern, energy-efficient UPVC windows, Chrome Double
            Glazing is here to help.
